This is an interactive artwork 
Click to generate a wave. 
The wave's color depends on the position of the ball when clicking.
For example, if you click while the ball is in the 'RED' part,
the generated wave has a red color.
For an immersive experience, the ball also changes size 
depending on the volume of the added soundtrack.
